# PlayerJobs
Bukkit Jobs Plugin

## What is
Players can create 'job' signs that allow them to employ other players for cold, hard vault $$$.
The signs have an internal chest, balance to pay employees from, and settings menu.

## How do
* Write [Job] at the top of a sign - put whatever you like on the other lines

* Customise the job via the sign's inventory UI - do fun stuff like:
    * Deposit money for your employees' wages
    * Select up to 5 item types that your employees can get paid for, and configure their wage for each
    * Fire any employees that are gross
    * View your employee logs for the past week (via radical rollover chat buttons)
    * Empty out your job inventory so your employees can put their junk up in there
    
* And that's pretty much it it. The menu buttons have rollover tooltips so it's all fairly self-explanatory.
